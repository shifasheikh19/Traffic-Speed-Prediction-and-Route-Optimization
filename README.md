# Traffic-Speed-Prediction-and-Route-Optimization
This project aims to predict real-time traffic speeds and optimize vehicle routes using machine learning techniques, specifically Gradient Boosting, and the Google OR-Tools library. The project integrates weather and traffic data to adjust route planning dynamically based on predicted traffic conditions.
**Features**
Traffic Speed Prediction: Utilizes Gradient Boosting to predict traffic speeds based on various features such as free flow speed, temperature, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Route Optimization: Adjusts the distance matrix for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) using the predicted traffic speeds, resulting in optimized delivery routes.
Visualization: Provides visual comparisons between predicted and actual traffic speeds and the cost of routes before and after traffic adjustment.
